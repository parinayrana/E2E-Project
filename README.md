🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher

Git

Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv or conda)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject.git
cd mlproject
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The application will start, and you can access it via http://localhost:5000.

🧰 Features
Modular Pipeline: Each stage of the ML process is modularized, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

Web Interface: A Flask-based web application allows users to interact with the model for predictions.

CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions workflows are set up for continuous integration and deployment.

Deployment Ready: Configurations are provided for deploying the application on platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

📁 Notebooks
The notebook/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model experimentation

Performance evaluation

These notebooks serve as a sandbox for testing ideas before integrating them into the main pipeline.

📦 Deployment
The project includes configurations for deploying the application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The .ebextensions/ directory contains the necessary setup files. Ensure you have an AWS account and the AWS CLI configured to proceed with deployment.
